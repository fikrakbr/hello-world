# hello-world
First time practicing the GitHub flow after 4 years having an account (?).
My name is Fikri Akbar, a mechanical engineering major student trying out new stuff in order to find drive, delight, and passion in life. I am interested in data engineering, especially relating to mechanical engineering cases (if that even applies haha). So yeah, just trying stuff out, hopefully leading to something contributive.
